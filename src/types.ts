/*
 * WHY THESE TYPES MATTER:
 * Non-tech readers: Think of these as standardized forms that ensure
 * all parts of our extension "speak the same language" when sharing data.
 * 
 * Future changes: If we need to add new information (like mouse coordinates),
 * we just update these type definitions and TypeScript will tell us
 * everywhere in the code that needs to be updated.
